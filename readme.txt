A WordPress plugin to effortlessly monitor content update-related data for your WordPress posts and pages in a user-friendly dashboard, all exportable with a convenient 1-click export.

== Description ==

The Content Update Tracker plugin helps you keep track of the Last Updated Date for each post and page on your WordPress website.


The "Last Updated Date" of your posts and pages is crucial for many reasons. Posts that have not been updated for a long time may suffer from Content Decay, affecting their search engine rankings. Knowing when to update a post or page can help you maintain or even improve your rankings.


The Content Update Tracker Plugin simplifies monitoring the age of your posts & pages and helps you to make crucial decisions based on that.

It automatically categorizes posts into four different categories:

- GREEN: Posts Updated in the last 3 Months
- YELLOW: Posts Updated in the last 3 to 6 Months
- ORANGE: Posts Updated in the last 6 to 12 Months
- RED: Posts that have NOT been updated for longer than 12 Months

For each category, you can export data to .csv for analysis in tools like Google Sheets. 

After performing any update on a post or page in WordPress, the plugin automatically re-categorizes the post or page and puts it in the correct category (usually into the GREEN category because as soon as a post is updated, it is obviously completely fresh).

The plugin also moves posts & pages among categories over time completely automatically. So, for instance, after publishing an article, if you don't update it for 3 months, you will find this post moving from the GREEN category into the YELLOW category. 

With this plugin, you'll always know which posts/pages are up-to-date and which need updating.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

### How do I use this plugin?

After activating the plugin, you will find a new item in the WP dashboard called "Content Update Tracker."

Click on it, and you will then see the Content Update Dashboard. You will see at one glance which posts were recently updated and which posts have not been updated for a long time.

Generally speaking, it is good to start with updating posts in the RED category, as these posts have not been updated for an extended period of time.

You can also export all the data by simply clicking on either "Export All," "Export Green," "Export Yellow," or "Export Orange," or "Export Red."

To export all the info, simply click on "Export All."


### What is the Notes feature?

With the help of the Notes feature, you can leave notes in every post or page. This is very useful because when you perform updates, you can leave a note in the post that either states what updates you did in the last update or if you have a whole team of people that are working on these posts, you could also use the Notes feature to give other people instructions on what needs to be adjusted when performing the update. 

### Does the Content Update Tracker Plugin work both in the Classic Editor and the Gutenberg Editor?

Yes, the Content Update Tracker WordPress plugin works just fine in both editors. All the features work in both editors. 


### Can you exclude certain posts & pages from being monitored and categorized?

Yes. This feature was integrated because for some posts & pages, like the Contact page or the "About Us" section, the Last Updated Date is usually irrelevant. You can exclude these contents from the list by clicking on the cross symbol next to the name of the post/page in the dashboard list. These posts and pages will then be added to the "Excluded List." You can access this list by clicking on "Excluded List" in the dashboard. 


### How can I open up exported data?

Data can be exported in either CSV format or Excel format. To open up CSV files, you can use the free Google Sheets software that can be accessed online. All you need for it is a Google account. If you do own Microsoft Excel, then you can simply open up the exported files in Excel. 



### How to uninstall the Content Update Tracker plugin?

To uninstall the plugin:
1. Deactivate it from the **Plugins** page. 
2. Once deactivated, click on "Delete" to delete the plugin.
